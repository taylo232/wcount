#wcount

A basic word count and 'reading ease' calculation (plain text files)

USE: At the commandline: wcount text.txt

If no text file is nominated then the script will ask for a text file to work with.

This is one of the first Python scripts I wrote as I learnt to program so it is probably very inefficient and poorly written but you have to start somewhere!
